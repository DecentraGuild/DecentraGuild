## What is a dGuild?

A **dGuild** is a self-custodied, legally recognized association operated by its members. Each dGuild runs on a foundation of:

- **On-chain custody** via Squads multisig vaults
- **Two complementary DAOs from Realms** for governance
- **Non-transferable member tokens** for identity and voting
- **Legal wrappers** for real-world legitimacy

Guilds can rebrand their UI, avatar sets, and guild identity while still relying on the same core template technology.

### Core Principles

#### On-Chain Custody
Your guild holds its own custodial control. Multisig vaults and on-chain contracts store assets and execute flows. The platform doesn't hold any of your assets.

#### Two-Layer Governance
Two separate DAOs combine into a top-layer "guild vote" with adjustable weighting, letting communities express different participation signals.

#### Leadership
The combined guild selects a Council for treasury management and operations, who appoint officers for day-to-day tasks and community management.

#### Legal Entity
Each dGuild is a real legal entity with proper legal wrappers, enabling operation in both digital and real-world environments with full legal responsibilities.

---

## Core Concepts

### DAO for King

dGuild governance uses a dual-DAO system that balances operational efficiency with participation, ensuring both contributors and stability providers have appropriate voice.

#### Combined Guild Vote
After DAO1 and DAO2 votes conclude, their weighted results combine into a single guild decision. **Example:** 60% weight to DAO1, 40% to DAO2 (configurable per guild).

**Combined Guild Vote Requirements:**
- Council Selection
- Major Parameter Changes
- Strategic Direction

#### DAO1 — Contribution DAO
**Token1 holders** vote on operational decisions and community matters:
- Quest and mission approval
- Community event planning
- Operational policy decisions
- Member engagement

#### DAO2 — Stability DAO
**Token2 holders** vote on how to deploy staking assets to earn returns:
- Staking deployment strategies
- Asset allocation decisions
- Return optimization approaches
- Risk management policies

### The Token Economy

Understanding the dual-token economy that powers dGuild operations and member incentives.

#### Token1 — Contribution Token
**Purpose:** Enable DAO1 voting and secure a voice in the organisation  
**Backing:** Peg/backing defined at creation with fixed mint ratio  
**Allocation:** Token1 allocation can be configured by the dGuild  
**Minting:** dGuild mints Token1 to distribute to contributors  
**Utility:** Voting in DAO1 or redeemed for pegged backing asset  
**Privacy:** Non-transferable (private to members)

Your guild's contribution token - stable in design and non-speculative. Members earn Token1 by contributing to the guild's success through missions, activities, and active participation.

#### Token2 — Stability Token
**Purpose:** Provide organizational stability and long-term alignment  
**Backing:** Can be deployed to earn staking rewards for the organization  
**Allocation:** Allocation of deposited assets can be configured by the dGuild  
**Minting:** Members can mint Token2 and help the dGuild earn staking rewards  
**Utility:** Voting in DAO2 or earn staking rewards  
**Privacy:** Non-transferable, Redeeming is subject to DAO policies (private to members)

Your guild's stability token - designed to provide organizational stability and long-term alignment. Members mint Token2 by depositing backing assets, representing a portion of the pooled reserves.

#### Platform Fees
Both Token1 and Token2 minting subject to platform fees paid in the asset backing (not dGuild tokens).

### Legal Framework

Each dGuild is anchored in the real world through **legal wrappers**. This is what makes dGuilds more than just digital collectives. Every dGuild operates as a legitimate legal entity with proper governance structures, tax compliance, and regulatory adherence.

#### Legal Components

**Statutes (Bylaws)**
Comprehensive governance documents that define the guild's structure, rules, and operational procedures. These legally binding bylaws establish member rights, decision-making processes, and organizational frameworks that ensure proper governance and legal compliance.

**Corporate Tax**
Automated corporate tax reporting and compliance management for the dGuild entity. Generate professional tax reports, maintain compliance with corporate tax obligations, and ensure proper documentation for regulatory requirements and financial transparency.

**Personal Tax**
Member tax reporting and documentation support for individual contributions and earnings. Provide members with detailed transaction records, earnings reports, and tax documentation to support their personal tax obligations and financial planning.

### The dGuild Lifecycle

Every dGuild follows a **structured template**, ensuring security, stability and room for growth. This journey transforms from initial establishment through configuration, operation, and evolution.

#### Phase 1: Establish
The foundational phase where the dGuild's core infrastructure and governance are created.

Deploy Squads multisig vaults for treasury and custody, define Token1 (Contribution) and Token2 (Stability) parameters, establish DAO1 (contributions) and DAO2 (stability), submit founding bylaws, goals, and legal wrapper, then elect the initial Council.

#### Phase 2: Build
Fine-tuning the dGuild's operational parameters and settings for optimal performance.

Customize dApp theme and guild branding, configure quests, rewards, and incentives, define vault distributions and monthly revenue splits, set minting fees and routing policies, and establish council policies and spending limits.

#### Phase 3: Operate
The active phase where the dGuild launches its community features and begins collaborating with its members.

Launch quests, achievements, and NFTs, council manages vaults and approves initiatives, members earn Token1 through contributions and Token2 through staking, values are distributed into vaults automatically, and community engages through events, quests, and tournaments.

#### Phase 4: Grow
The continuous improvement phase where the dGuild adapts and grows based on community needs and market conditions.

Proposals adjust governance parameters and council roles, quests and reward mechanics evolve with feedback, partnerships expand reach and influence, and compliance and legal updates are applied as needed.

**Note:** The lifecycle is **iterative** — guilds revisit phases as they scale, ensuring balance between contributors, stability providers, and leadership.

### A la Carte

While we work towards delivering the complete dGuild package, we offer **modular room solutions** that allow communities to use finished components and build their own customized toolkit.

#### Key Features

**Modular Components**
Individual rooms with preset logic that can be deployed independently. Each component is fully functional and can be combined with others to create a custom dGuild experience.

**Ready-to-Use Logic**
Pre-built smart contracts for common functions like token creation in the Foundry, G2P trading in the Armory, and governance mechanisms in the DAO.

**Custom Skinning**
Various theming and branding options to make each component uniquely yours. Customize the UI, colors, icons, and terminology to match your community's identity.

**Funding Development**
Revenue from A la Carte deployments helps fund new smart contract development and infrastructure improvements, accelerating the path to the complete dGuild platform.

#### Getting Started
Each A la Carte component includes setup fees and ongoing maintenance costs, but provides immediate functionality for your community. As we develop new features, existing deployments can be upgraded or expanded with additional modules.

## Summary

The DecentraGuild framework provides dGuilds with the tools and platform needed to thrive in Web3.

The complete toolkit includes **DAO governance** (DAO is KING), **Vaults** for secure asset management, **Armory, Foundry, Quest Board** for engagement and growth, **Trophy Room and Tavern** for culture and community, **Command Centre and Observatory** for leadership and strategy, **Integrations and Gatekeeping** for scalability and security, and **Legal** wrappers for compliance.

### Important Note
We provide the **tools and platform** for your organization to succeed, but we cannot run your organization for you. Each dGuild must take full responsibility for their own future, operations, and success. The framework gives you the foundation — the rest is up to you.

### Conclusion
In short: a **digital castle for Web3 guilds** — secure, decentralized, and rebrandable for any community. Ready to build your digital kingdom?
