    <p>All guild management tasks flow through this subchamber. Create and organize NFT collections, define quest parameters, set up new rewards, and adjust member privileges. The Command Center connects directly to other rooms such as the Foundry (for minting assets) and the Quest Board (for deployment).</p>
