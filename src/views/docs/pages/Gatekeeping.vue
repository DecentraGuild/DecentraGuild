      <p>This system maintains <strong>security and trust</strong>, making sure each member is both legitimate and aligned with guild values. Think of it as the castle's gate â€” not to keep people out, but to ensure only the right people get in.</p>

        <h4>dGuild Access</h4>

        <h4>Role-Based Permissions</h4>
        <p>Access control manages permissions for council, officers, and members. Different roles have different levels of access to guild resources, ensuring proper hierarchy and security throughout the organization.</p>
