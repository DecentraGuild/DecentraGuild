Recommended Development Strategy
Here's my recommended approach for your dApp rebuild, considering you're not a professional developer:

Phase 1: Foundation & Navigation (Weeks 1-2)
Start with the navigation system first - this is your foundation and will guide everything else.
Create the Castle Navigation Component
Build a new navigation system using the infographic images as clickable areas
Map each castle room image to its corresponding functionality
Implement hover effects and visual feedback
Make it responsive for mobile devices
Set up the New Project Structure
Create a fresh Vue.js project with TypeScript
Set up your routing system to match the castle rooms
Implement a clean, modular component structure

Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 3-4)
Build the essential building blocks that other features depend on.
Authentication & User Management
Wallet connection (Solana integration)
User profile system
Role-based permissions (Council, Officers, Members)
State Management
Set up Pinia for global state management
Create stores for user data, guild data, and blockchain interactions

Phase 3: Essential Rooms (Weeks 5-8)
Implement the core castle rooms that provide the most value.
Priority Order:
Vault - Treasury management (most critical)
DAO - Governance system
Command Centre - Admin dashboard
Community Hub - Guild identity and branding

Phase 4: Engagement Features (Weeks 9-12)
Add the interactive elements that drive user engagement.
Quest Board - Task management system
Foundry - Token and NFT creation
Trophy Room - Achievement system
Tavern - Social features and mini-games

Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 13-16)
Complete the ecosystem with remaining functionality.
Armory - Asset management
Observatory - Analytics and reporting
Gatekeeping - Access control
Integrations - External platform connections
Why This Approach Works Best

1. Navigation-First Strategy
Visual Foundation: The castle infographic gives users an immediate understanding of the system
Intuitive UX: Users can see all available features at a glance
Scalable: Easy to add new rooms as you develop them

2. Building Blocks Approach
Modular Development: Each room can be developed independently
Incremental Value: You can deploy and test each room as it's completed
Easier Debugging: Smaller, focused components are easier to troubleshoot

3. Risk Mitigation
Early Validation: You can test the navigation and core concepts quickly
User Feedback: Get feedback on the castle concept before building everything
Flexible Timeline: You can adjust priorities based on what works best
