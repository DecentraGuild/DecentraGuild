  <h2 id="issues">Issues with Traditional Business Models</h2>
  <p>
    When we examine the current business models, several issues come to light. Traditional companies with stocks are often inflexible, slow to adapt, and expensive to alter. These models have their limitations, and it's time for a new approach.
  </p>

  <h2 id="flawed-tokenomics">Flawed Tokenomics in Web3 Space</h2>
  <p>
    Exploring the web3 space, we find that many projects suffer from flawed tokenomics, where tokens are simply released on a set schedule without regard for value added. The current approach to tokenomics has its drawbacks, and it's time for a more sustainable solution.
  </p>

  <h2 id="dGuild">dGuild - Digital Co-ops</h2>
  <p>
    At dGuild - Digital Co-ops, we're committed to solving the problems inherent in traditional business models and flawed tokenomics. We've developed a double tokenomic system that allows projects to separate their financial investment from the time and effort required to complete them. Our platform provides a safe and sustainable solution for businesses, metaverse projects, and other web3 ecosystems.
